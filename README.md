So if you found your way here from the website, my condolences ;)

This is a learner project more than anything and is barely an MVP - loads can be improved...

- Started off thinking the context API will be sufficient, but things got real messy real quick.
- I come from an Angular background and know rxjs well so used that for state management
- Hooks vs subscribing to observables is a bit inconsistent right now
